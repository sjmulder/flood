.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
repeatedly invokes a command with a short delay between invocations.
It does not wait for previous invocations to finish.
Output is discarded,
but results are summarily reported using single characters:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Character" ".Sy Meaning"
.It Sy Character Ta Sy Meaning
.It Li . Ta Command invoked
.It Li * Ta Command completed successfully
.It Li ! Ta Command completed with an error status
.It Li @ Ta Error invoking the command
.El

A tally of the number of invocations, successes and failures
is printed when the program terminates, by
.Dv SIGINT
.Pq Ctrl+C
or otherwise, or when sent
.Dv SIGINFO
.Pq Ctrl+T
on supported systems like BSD and macOS.
.Pp
The name and inspiration come from the
.Xr ping 1

option.
